# Morpheus README

This site is more or less a practice page.

Eventually I may get around to doing something useful with it!

Most of the information here won't mean much to anyone
but Dave. There are maintenance notes for internal use.

# Rockets

| Filename            | Destination         | Default App  |
|---------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| aloralyn.org.html   | snaggy.html         | Snaggy       |
| nyteowldave.me.html | ez-table.html       | E-Z Table    |
| snaggy.html         | 173.217.64.99:64264 | Snaggy       |
| debbie.html         | 173.217.64.99:64429 | Debbie       |
| ez-table.html       | 173.217.64.99:4242  | E-Z Table    |

This may be a bit confusing, since this is a first. I've never used
rockets to reroute to other rockets before!

Seems kinda like a train switching station or something, eh?

This had to be done because I was loosing track of which ports
and IP addresses were targeted by which rockets and domain names!

Add to that which default app to expect when any of the above
addresses are used and you get pandemonium (or sheer madness).
